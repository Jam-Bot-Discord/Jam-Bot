Hello hello! Welcome to our new site, the new home of Jam Bot! We've revamped the docs entirely and improved our site to make it easier to navigate.  
 
We're still in the early stages at the moment, so expect a few bugs here and there, but we're improving the bot and documentation daily, so expect cool features soon!  

If you have an issue with anything (whether that be the bot or the documentation) [open an issue](https://github.com/jamesatjaminit/Jam-Bot/issues/new) on our repo, and I'll be more than happy to help! You can also click "edit this page" on any of our documentation pages, to suggest an edit!
