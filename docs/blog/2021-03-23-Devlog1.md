I think it's finally time to do one of these, I'm going to focus mostly on the things I've been adding recently, but I'll brush over everything in general.

# Documentation
![Docs index page](/img/docsIndexPage.png)
*Above: The main page of the documentation*  
This is one of the areas I think looks particularly nice, I moved from plain HTML to [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) which is a project by Facebook open source. It's super easy to setup and really easy to maintain, it also means that I don't have to worry about styling anymore (since I'm not very good at it). I've still got quite a bit to add and tweak, for example the default images on the index page, but honestly it will do for now.
# Bot

I think it would be best to first explain the basics of what my bot does when it recieves a message.
